      <h1>Barbell Squat</h1>
      <p>
        The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes
        building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the
        classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a
        lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the
        sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body
        strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the
        emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets
        worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles
        to sets of 20 reps or higher.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should
          be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the
          feet turned out as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as
          much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure
          that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as
          upright as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the
          heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the
          motion, driving the weight upward.
        </li>
      </ol>
